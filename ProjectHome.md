This is a very simple application (written in Java) that aims to test multiple instances of IBM DB2 at same time with just one application through Command Line Interface. The test itself is just a connection try, plus a current and average time (in milliseconds) of each successful connection.

The User Interface is designed to work in a command line shell. It uses a Curses implementation for Java (jcurses).
